## Testing solution

When run application, a REST end-point is initialized. You can submit a simple test
audio [file (audio-demo.flac)](src/test/resources/audio/audio-demo.flac) to test the API

### Using CURL

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transcript' --form 'file=@"/audio/audio-demo.flac"'
```

### Using Postman

- Crea new HTTP `POST` request and select `body` tab
- Choose `form-data` like payload type
- Add new `key` with name `file`
- Add [file (audio-demo.flac)](src/test/resources/audio/audio-demo.flac) as `value`

Independent of API call method you choose, if all work fine, you obtain the above response:

```json lines
{
  "text": "a line of severe thunderstorms with several possible tornadoes is approaching Colorado on Sunday "
}
```
